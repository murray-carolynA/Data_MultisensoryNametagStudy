This data is intended to be shared for open science purposes, to allow other psychological researchers to have access to our data. This data is NOT intended for commercial use. If you use this data in your analyses, please cite the associated paper.


OVERVIEW: 
Data have been separated by experiment, with a ReadMe in each folder to highlight important columns for analyzing each data set. 

Experiments 1-4 were run using PsychoPy. Each file represents 1 participant, and rater files are separate from participant data. Folders with Rater scores have “Rater” in the folder name. 

Experiment 5 was run using Qualtrics. One file contains all participants with associated rater scores for recall accuracy.
